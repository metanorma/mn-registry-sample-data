<p id="_6827283b-faff-4528-8955-aa8a7e0ae655">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_98df27fc-c544-4b2b-adfc-c5a31b1161ac">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_d26d8194-b9fc-4247-8dc0-30474b2ba5a6">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_8a1553bd-6035-411e-a51c-f256bd158779">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_8c9afecf-777c-45cc-b21c-6a520319ba5b">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_21a2ea8c-a64e-40e6-87a6-074cef49a830">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_cb59d393-c290-4f94-863f-e518b0e5c416">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_c564a80b-f1eb-408d-a64d-52749987ab26">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_aaeb1ded-7b55-4611-bdb0-8c95c05016f8">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_6675c2bf-c910-42fd-ab4e-aa8eea842be4">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_d67b04c6-a8bd-4e6b-8ba1-7edc865b836c">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_75bf2001-33e0-40e5-8f2b-ba4823ffb794">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
