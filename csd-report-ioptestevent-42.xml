organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_ae618292-c29c-400a-b066-6703e57f1825">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international

<p id="_a5733280-6ca7-46f1-9f42-7c78eb790cf9">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_401ab0b6-96ab-4c46-b6ce-6c816cb6e710">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_3a17dde3-1dc1-4286-84d4-c34ec6adb8c1">Spherical Cow Group</p>   
  </li>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_2f0a8227-d3cd-42fa-b72a-62527f75b027">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_3a50faf5-c11b-4737-8d9b-a5bd85153484">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_3e70336c-e0d8-4c81-adf5-b1f48aa612db">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_674b42f6-ab2c-46d8-80f2-ae8d4649a341">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_45dfeff8-cccc-4323-aea9-a3c4dd33bfc3">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_c2b3fe9d-c261-4c50-9593-12f25b153259">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
