non-profit organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of   
collaborative technologies and tools through open standards.</p>  
<p id="_6b05c4fb-0d34-49a7-8796-454e09a3dc5b">CalConnect works closely with international and regional partners,   
of which the full list is available on our website

across the globe and communities of practice.</p>   
<p id="_1085436a-40cb-43f2-aad0-15226325d6ab">As a proponent of open standards, CalConnect does not endorse    
mandatory usage of patents within CalConnect Standards.    
The CalConnect Board of Directors has decided to align    
IPR practice with major international standardization bodies    
including ISO, IEC and ITU.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_purpose" obligation="informative"><title>Purpose</title><p id="_b4c541f9-51f5-4045-941c-57b756e5c9fc">This document describes the policy of CalConnect with regards to patent    
usage within CalConnect deliverables and provides a    
“code of practice” that is simple and straightforward.</p>   
<p id="_be60606c-7ac6-4951-9b93-5a3f0b47832c">CalConnect deliverables are drawn up by technical, not patent, experts,    
who may not be fully aware of all nuisances in the complex    
international legal situation of intellectual property rights.</p>   
<p id="_d5ebb625-f56a-4492-8d27-cc50a7db1ccd">CalConnect deliverables are non-binding — their objective is to ensure    
compatibility of technologies and systems on a worldwide basis.</p>   
<p id="_54c0ac7b-394c-44a9-b185-6367c6308dff">To ensure the applicability and accessibility of CalConnect    
deliverables, the implementation and continued usage of content within    
the deliverables must be possible to the worldwide audience without    
discrimination, including any patent embodiment in such deliverables.</p></clause></introduction></preface><sections>
